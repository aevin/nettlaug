	<h2 class="featurette-heading">About Hackeriet's Nettlaug</h2>
	<p class="lead">
		Hackeriet has built a server room and is installing a fibre internet linkup. This means that we now can offer the sofisticated nerd an "anything goes" server at 100mbit for a very reasonable price, --many times more affordable than any commercial provider out there.

	<p>
		Hackeriet gets a gigabit  fibre line, peers with the free exchange FIXO and becomes an ISP! "We pay for this how?!" you might ask. With high availability comes great value: we can now host servers on our own fully operational Death Star. Pay hackeriet 250 a  month and the server is yours to do with as you please, to point The Ray at any target you should dream of.

	<p>Don't have a server to put online? That's ok, we have plenty of iron for no extra charge.</p>

		This is a non-commercial venture, and the server rent is going towards covering the cost of the fiber line, power and infrastructure maitenence. SLA when it comes to uptime is Hackeriets "best effort" and the EULA is remnicent of "Kardemommeloven" (Don't know what that is forreign muthafucker? GGGGoogle it!). What this means is: members are a contributing factor to the networks stability and other members will help you only of their own volition and the goodness of their tiny cynical hearts.
